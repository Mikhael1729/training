# CP Training Solved Exercises

Here is my code of the solved exercises of my training on competitive programming. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m79LO2yuanMRnAZ1Qs8JMj1T14mfzfXAjj8xkFarRwA/edit?usp=sharing) is the training guide I'm following on.

## Install dependencies

If you are me, you don't use an IDE to compile your code nor the scolastic way of compiling (using the command line compiler tool). No, you use `ccpp` command line app made for you :P. Install it first.
 
## Run the code of a solved problem

Each directory in the repository stores solved problems for a specific CP level category.

1. Enter to a directory.
2. Execute `ccpp <name of the problem>.cpp`.
